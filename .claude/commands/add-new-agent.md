# /add-new-agent

Use this workflow when working on **add-new-agent** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new agent to the project, including documentation and registration.

## Common Files

- `agents/*.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/COMMAND-AGENT-MAP.md`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create a new agent markdown file under agents/<agent-name>.md
- Register the agent in AGENTS.md
- Optionally update README.md and docs/COMMAND-AGENT-MAP.md
- Optionally add agent TOML config under .codex/agents/

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
