# /add-new-skill-or-agent

Use this workflow when working on **add-new-skill-or-agent** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new skill or agent to the system, including documentation, registration, and sometimes test coverage.

## Common Files

- `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `agents/*.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `rules/common/agents.md`
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/*/agents/openai.yaml`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create or update SKILL.md in skills/<skill-name>/ or agents/<agent-name>.md
- Register the agent/skill in AGENTS.md or rules/common/agents.md
- If applicable, add OpenAI/Codex YAML config in .agents/skills/<skill>/agents/openai.yaml
- If applicable, add command documentation in commands/<command>.md
- If applicable, add test files in tests/hooks/ or tests/lib/

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
